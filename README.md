**This project is an API for sending emails, designed for integration with microservices systems.**

This API was developed using the Java programming <br> language and Spring Boot technology.


**How to Use:**

⚠ To use the API, since the only official implementation I included in the project was for AWS SES, it's important that you have an AWS account to use the API. ⚠

<h5> AWS accounts can be essentially free, which is why I chose to use their services. </h5>

To use it in production, you will need to run the code on the server so that other services can use it. <br><br>

However, if you are only using it for private testing, you can just run Spring Boot in your IDE and access it via<br> 

`localhost:8080/api/email.`

Tip: Use tools like Insomnia for local testing.
